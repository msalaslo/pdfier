                                The primary purpose of ISO 14289 (known as PDF/UA, for "Universal Accessibility") is to define how to represent electronic documents in the PDF format in a manner that allows the file to be accessible. This is accomplished by identifying the set of PDF components that may be used and restrictions on the form of their use.
                                PDF/UA is intended as a companion standard, to be used in conjunction with ISO 32000, ISO 19005, ISO 15930 and other standards as may apply for the purpose of achieving accessibility or as mandated by this International Standard. In order for PDF/UA conforming files to be truly accessible, requirements on conforming readers and conforming assistive technology are also stipulated herein....
                                PDF/UA is a technical standard providing detailed code-level requirements for PDF software developers. It does not contain best practices or implementation guidance beyond the normative and informative text. This committee has produced several informative documents for developers implementing PDF/UA.

                                There are many real world applications for our service. A lot of people use it to create an accessible PDF from a URL directly, so they can use the PDF for offline reading, archiving etc. Here's a short list of what our service can do: 
                                <ul>

									<li>Allow visitors of your website to save any webpage as accessible PDF with a single click</li>
									<li>Select areas within your webpage that you want to convert to accessible PDF or want to exclude from the conversion</li>
									<li>Add additional non-web functionality to your converted accessible PDF, such as watermarking.</li>
								</ul>
